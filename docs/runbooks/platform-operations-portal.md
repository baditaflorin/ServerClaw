# Platform Operations Portal

## Purpose

The operations portal is a generated static site under `build/ops-portal/`.

It gives operators one place to answer:

- where does a service live
- which VM owns it
- what subdomain points at it
- which runbook documents it
- which ADR introduced it
- which agent tools already exist

## Generation

Generate the portal locally:

```bash
make generate-ops-portal
```

This renders:

- `build/ops-portal/index.html`
- `build/ops-portal/environments/index.html`
- `build/ops-portal/vms/index.html`
- `build/ops-portal/subdomains/index.html`
- `build/ops-portal/runbooks/index.html`
- `build/ops-portal/adrs/index.html`
- `build/ops-portal/agents/index.html`

The generator reads:

- `config/environment-topology.json`
- `config/service-capability-catalog.json`
- `config/subdomain-catalog.json`
- `config/agent-tool-registry.json`
- `versions/stack.yaml`
- `docs/adr/*.md`
- `docs/runbooks/*.md`

## Health Data

The portal can embed a generation-time health snapshot:

```bash
uvx --from pyyaml python scripts/generate_ops_portal.py \
  --health-snapshot path/to/snapshot.json \
  --write
```

When no snapshot is provided, the portal still renders and marks service health as `unknown`.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
uvx --from pyyaml python scripts/generate_ops_portal.py --check
```

That renders the site in a temporary directory and verifies that all expected pages are present.

## Deployment Boundary

This workstream implements the generated site and repo automation.

Publishing `ops.lv3.org` live still requires a deliberate apply from `main` so the edge VM, DNS, and certificate state converge together.
